SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married. He does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days. Does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use. He was on no prescribed medications. He did have a fairly normal PSA of about 119 and I had ordered a renal ultrasound which showed fairly normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass, but it was consistent with increased echogenicity in the cortex, findings representative of medical renal disease.
